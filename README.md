## Explanation on how to use it
When the program prompts you to enter a number you can enter (for example):
```
8
65
982

*This program does NOT do deciamls, so there is no need to be worrying about needing to calculate all of pi*

#### What it should look like (or at least close enough to it)

```
Enter a number between 1-1000:
512

The number is lower!

342

The number is higher!:

405

The number is lower!:

386

You got it right!  The number was 386!
```
